Please note that we are developing Glimpse Image Editor in two parallel streams.

The "fork" stream is already providing a workable solution for people who dislike the "gimp" name or encounter barriers when they advocate the GNU Image Manipulation Program in schools, universities and workplaces. You can read more about our development priorities and our target userbase here: https://github.com/glimpse-editor/Glimpse/wiki/Development-Priorities

The "rewrite" stream (also known as "Glimpse NX") aims to create a lightweight new interface for pre-existing GNU Image Manipulation Program libraries and frameworks. We will provide more details about that project in coming months.
