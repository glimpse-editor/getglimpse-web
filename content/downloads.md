### Linux
We distribute Glimpse Image Editor 0.1.0 on Flathub. If Flatpak is not already installed on your machine, follow these instructions: https://flatpak.org/setup/

Once setup is complete you can find Glimpse by searching in your distribution's software center, or you can click on this button:

<a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.glimpse_editor.Glimpse">
    <img src="https://flathub.org/assets/badges/flathub-badge-en.png" alt="Download on Flathub" width="240">
</a>

Alternatively you can install it manually at the command line:
```
$ flatpak install flathub org.glimpse_editor.Glimpse
```

#### Community-supported sources
These packages are provided by third parties in the wider Glimpse community. We sometimes merge changes to the codebase they provide us with but they are not directly supported by the Glimpse project.

* [Glimpse](https://snapcraft.io/glimpse-editor) on Snapcraft
* [`glimpse-editor-git`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/glimpse-editor-git/) in the AUR

### MacOS
The Glimpse project does not support the MacOS platform at this time. We recommend you use the [Seashore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seashore_%28software%29) variant of the GNU Image Manipulation Program instead.

### Build our code
We have provided instructions for building and packaging the Glimpse Image Editor source code on our project wiki: https://wiki.glimpse-editor.org/index.php?title=Building_Glimpse
