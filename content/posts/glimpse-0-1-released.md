Three months ago you worked with us to start rebranding and improving one of the most complex and widely-used free software projects that has ever existed. None of us approached the task with any prior knowledge of the codebase, but we all embarked on this journey with the belief that a decade was too long to wait for the changes we asked for.

Glimpse 0.1 is probably not a major step forward for the world of computing! But for our project, we have taken the first step on a journey to forge a new application and a new way of doing things, and the impact is already being felt across the free software world.

## For school and for work
From day one we have focussed on what you need from us to successfully pitch for Glimpse to be distributed across your organization.

The word "gimp" has also been eliminated throughout the graphical user interface, and that removes [a known hurdle to adoption](../about/#what-is-wrong-with-the-gimp-name) in some English-speaking countries.

The Windows version has been packaged as an MSI installer so your IT systems administrator can more easily distribute Glimpse with their own centralised software management tools such as Novell ZENworks, Symantec Client Management Suite, Microsoft InTune and similar products.

Glimpse has also been packaged as a ZIP file so you can run the software from a USB flash drive or a network location when you move between different Windows computers on a corporate or academic network.

We plan to make future releases easier for organizations to support by providing our own help pages, online forums and tutorial materials. Glimpse project will also build on "known stable" versions of the GNU Image Manipulation Program and provide bug-fixes for at least one year from the initial release date.

## Fewer distractions
We love Wilber (a mascot for the GNU Image Manipulation Program), but you told us it was a little *too* prominent throughout the application!

The toolbar headers filled with "floating Wilber head" artwork have been removed to recover screen space on lower resolution monitors. The distracting eyeballs in the main window that followed your cursor across the screen and blinked red if you left the application idle for too long are also gone.

Switching to a modern new logo also assists children with learning disabilities feel more comfortable when they run the application, because Wilber is not staring back at them from the task bar and top-left corner of the application window when they use Glimpse.

## Packaged for GNU/Linux
You told us that Flatpaks should be our primary distribution mechanism, so we worked hard to ensure that the version of Glimpse 0.1 you fetch from Flathub is as stable and performant as possible. Contributors can also [build Glimpse as they work on the code](https://wiki.glimpse-editor.org/index.php?title=Building_Glimpse/Linux) with the help of GNOME Builder.

We have also received contributions that enhance support for [Snapcraft](https://snapcraft.io/), so those who dislike or cannot run Flatpaks on their distribution have an alternative choice. An [AppImage](https://appimage.org/) will also be released within the next few weeks.

[Arch](https://www.archlinux.org/) users that want "bleeding edge" changes between official releases can make use of an unofficial community AUR channel that points directly to our development branch.

## A new way of doing things
Glimpse is the first free software project with a decision-making process this open and this accountable this early in its existence. You can see how we make decisions, you can participate in that process, you can decide where we spend your money, and you can plan our future direction.

Our community told us to be transparent, play nicely with others and listen to our users because nobody knows what you need from us better than you do. Those instructions have become our guiding principles, and they continue to determine our [evolving governance structure](../about/#how-does-this-project-govern-itself) and the tools we use to communicate and collaborate together.

We believe that developers refusing to listen to end users, dismissing ideas they dislike out-of-hand and imposing their own technical preferences on others is no longer acceptable. Everyone benefits when the community is open to new ideas, accountable to end users, welcoming to marginalized communities and respectful of opinions expressed in good faith. This project values non-code contributions just as highly as code contributions, because they are just as important to our users.

## Over to you
Let us know what you think of Glimpse 0.1. What worked well for you? What can we improve? What do you think we should include in Glimpse 0.2?
