Instead of providing a weekly reminder of our social media and project links across the web, check out our all-new [Contribute](../contribute/) page!

We are still on schedule to release Glimpse 0.1 some time in September 2019. The application is mostly code-complete, so the outstanding work items primarily relate to artwork, packaging and automated builds. Minor patches may also still be applied for code cleanup and documentation.

## Glimpse project adopts Open Collective
After feedback from the community asking us to support more donation methods, we have now setup an account on [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/glimpse).

The great thing about this service is that as supporters and users of Glimpse 0.1 you will be able see how much we receive in donations and how we use those funds to advance the project. It also means the business and legal side of receiving donations is taken care of for us by a well-known US-based charity, and more than one person can administer the funds.

We will continue to support Patreon donations for the foreseeable future, but periodically those funds will need to be transferred across to Open Collective. Switching across from Patreon gives you the option of sending one-off instead of monthly donations, is tax-deductible (in the US) and saves the project money on transfer fees.

## Work started on Travis CI integration
Based on a great suggestion from Mathieu Bridon, Bobby Moss has ported the Linux build instructions to Travis-CI and started testing automated builds using the system.

This is still a work in progress as Bobby wants to setup the publishing steps for Windows, Mac and Linux in the same build file. You can take a look at the latest progress here: https://github.com/glimpse-editor/Glimpse/tree/travis-ci

## New project logo
We are very grateful to the amazing [James Daniel](https://jamesdaniel.dev/) for worked with us to produce our project logo. We have finally banished the public domain question mark we were using as a placeholder to the dustbin of history!

He is still hard at work producing the application icons and artwork we will be using in Glimpse 0.1, so expect more news about this in the next week or two.
