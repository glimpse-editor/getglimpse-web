On Friday 22nd November 2019 we were pleased to announce our first binary release, Glimpse Image Editor 0.1.0. You can try it out for yourself on [our downloads page](/downloads/).

We are also pleased to announced that on Friday 29th November 2019 we released a new "signed" installer for the Windows platform. The previous "unsigned" version is still provided for troubleshooting purposes.

The work doesn't stop here though. In the New Year we will begin work on bug-fix releases to address translation problems and start working on 0.2.0. You can see a provisional roadmap with candidate issues [in these milestones](https://github.com/glimpse-editor/Glimpse/milestones/), but these are subject to change based on discussions in [our Matrix channel](https://matrix.to/#/#glimpse:matrix.org).

## Download Statistics
On the day we published this blog post there had been 3641 downloads from our own directly-supported channels. (We do not currently have figures for community-supported channels like Snapcraft and AUR, so this is likely an underestimate for the total number of downloads).

### Breakdown by platform and channel
* Unsigned Windows installer: 2037
* Signed Windows installer: 387

We would like to thank everyone that has tried out this release so far, and particularly those who have raised bugs and made feature suggestions.

## We closed our Patreon account
As we have mentioned in previous blog posts, we went ahead with our planned decision to close down our Patreon donation account on Friday 6th December 2019.

We now only accept donations to the project through [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/glimpse). That means we will now miss out on the donations we were receiving from Patreon (effectively halving the amount we receive each month), but we think the loss of revenue is outweighed by the advantages.

### Benefits from our perspective
* Fewer costs
* Easier management of backer rewards
* More than one person can administrate our fundraising campaign

### Benefits for our donors
* There's now the option to donate with a one-off payment *or* a monthly subscription
* US citizens can record contributions as a charitable donation for tax purposes
* The ability to review how we spend backer money helps potential donors make an informed decision before contributing

### Benefits for the wider community
* You can scrutinize how much money the project receives and from whom
* You can view itemized spending records and which individuals are paying for things on our behalf
* You can have confidence that an established 501c charity based in the United States with a proven track record is reviewing our expense claims and raised invoices before they are paid

### Patreon cash transfers
All the money we received through Patreon has been transferred to Open Collective over the past few months, and those transactions are listed under an "Incognito" user that is currently recorded as the top backer.

Our project's founder has also donated $100 over the last six months to cover the various fees and costs associated with those transfers, and ensured that our spending records on Open Collective cover every transaction since the project started on Friday 5th July 2019.

### Thank you to everyone who has donated so far
We believe we have gone above and beyond the usual level of transparency and scrutiny that most free software projects are willing to subject themselves to. We have chosen to do that to ensure governance team can be held accountable for its decisions by the Glimpse project, and to ensure our community can have confidence in our motives and intentions. If you have any concerns, then you are welcome to raise them with us on [our Matrix channel](https://matrix.to/#/#glimpse:matrix.org).

And, as usual, we encourage people to also [donate to the upstream project](https://www.gimp.org/donating/) to support the excellent work we rely on to make Glimpse Image Editor happen.
