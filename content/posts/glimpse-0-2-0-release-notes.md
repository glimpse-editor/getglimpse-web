This release...

## Installation
Linux users can install Glimpse Image Editor 0.2.0 as a Flatpak from the Flathub repository, and as a Snap from the Snap Store. There are also a number of additional installation options for Linux detailed on our [Downloads](/downloads/) page.

Windows users can use an MSI file to install Glimpse Image Editor 0.2.0 on 32-bit and 64-bit systems running Windows 7 or later. We chose that type of installer to assist businesses and schools using centralised software management systems. The two we have provided can also be found on the [Downloads](/downloads/) page.
